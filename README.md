# Foodservice & Industrial Kitchen Projects in JavaScript

This repository contains a series of practical JavaScript projects designed to learn programming by solving real problems from the foodservice and industrial kitchen environment.

Instead of generic beginner exercises, every project here is connected to real workflows I work with: production capacity, equipment planning, operational checklists, kitchen layout logic, and decision-making tools for high-demand food operations.

My goal with this repository is to learn JavaScript while building tools that reflect my background in foodservice engineering, kitchen layout design, and operational optimization.

## 📁 Projects Included

### **1. Production Capacity Calculator**
A simple tool to estimate hourly production based on equipment capacity, number of units, and cycle time. Useful for understanding throughput and planning production for pizzas, pastries, or any batch-based item.

### **2. Equipment & Cost Organizer**
A small application to register equipment, categories, energy consumption, and investment cost. Includes total cost calculation and category filtering.

### **3. Operational Checklist**
Interactive checklist for kitchen opening, production routines, and closing procedures. Counts completed tasks and updates status visually.

### **4. Production Kanban (Local Storage)**
A basic kanban board (To Do → In Production → Done) where tasks can be created, moved, and saved locally. Simulates a simple production management system.

### **5. Ingredient Price Estimator (API-based)**
Application that fetches product data from a public fake API and simulates cost estimation based on selected ingredients and quantities.

### **6. Operational Dashboard**
Dashboard with simulated data showing daily production, average preparation time, capacity utilization, and simple data visualization.

### **7. Layout & Bottleneck Simulator**
A tool to register kitchen sectors and equipment, calculate capacity per sector, and identify bottlenecks in the operational flow. Inspired by real kitchen layout logic and engineering analysis.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my learning path as I transition into software development.  
My focus is to:

- learn JavaScript through real-world, useful projects  
- apply programming to problems I already understand deeply  
- build a practical portfolio instead of abstract exercises  
- explore how tech can support foodservice operations and industrial workflows

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- LocalStorage (for some projects)
- Fetch API (for API-based projects)

No frameworks yet — the goal is to master fundamentals first.
