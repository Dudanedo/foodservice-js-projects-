# foodservice-js-projects-
This repository doc my learning path as I transition into software development. My focus is to: learn JavaScript through real-world, useful projects; apply programming to problems I already understand deeply; build a practical portfolio instead of abstract exercises and explore how tech can support foodservice operations and industrial workflows.
